##Date
2026 - 02 - 02

## Goal for Today
Understand Docker Images, containers & build first image

## Concepts learned
1. Overview of Docker
  - Virtualization tool & it helps to easily setup environment across all landscape (as the app along with its services and configurations are packaged)
2. Difference between VMs and Docker
  - Docker has its own OS but no Kernel & Kernel helps for communication with system hardware
  - Whereas, VM has its own OS and Kernel -> so it takes time to start and is huge in size as well
3. What's an image and container
   - Docker Image acts as a blueprint file and has everything (App, services, Light OS & all configuration files inside)
   - Container is the running docker image
Comparison: Docker image is the recipe & docker container is the dish made out of it
